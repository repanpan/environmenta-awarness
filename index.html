        <h1>Why Environmental Awareness is important</h1>
        <h3 class="contents">
          Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness
          around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its
          well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the
          earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the
          term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to
          protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As
          previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why
          the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large
          scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences
          of these human decisions and help the planet’s health take a complete
          180 degree in the other direction.

        <h1>Major Environmental Problems</h1>
        <h3 id="EnvironmentalIssues" class="contents">
          Some environmental life species require substantial areas to help
          provide food, living space, and other different assets. These
          creatures are called area specific. At the point when the biome is
          divided, the vast patches of living space don’t exist anymore. It
          becomes more troublesome for the wildlife to get the assets they need
          in order to survive. The environment goes on, even though the animals
          and plant life are not there to help sustain it properly.

              A more basic cause of environmental degradation is land damage.
              Numerous weedy plant species, for example, garlic & mustard, are
              both foreign and obtrusive. A rupture in the environmental
              surroundings provides for them a chance to start growing and
              spreading. These plants can assume control over nature,
              eliminating the local greenery. The result is a territory with a
              solitary predominant plant which doesn’t give satisfactory food
              assets to all the environmental life. Thus the whole environment
              can be destroyed because of these invasive species.
