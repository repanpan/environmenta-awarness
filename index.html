        <h1>Why Environmental Awareness is important</h1>
        <h3 class="contents">
          Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness
          around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its
          well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the
          earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the
          term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to
          protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As
          previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why
          the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large
          scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences
          of these human decisions and help the planet’s health take a complete
          180 degree in the other direction.

        <h1>Major Environmental Problems</h1>
        <h3 id="EnvironmentalIssues" class="contents">
          Some environmental life species require substantial areas to help
          provide food, living space, and other different assets. These
          creatures are called area specific. At the point when the biome is
          divided, the vast patches of living space don’t exist anymore. It
          becomes more troublesome for the wildlife to get the assets they need
          in order to survive. The environment goes on, even though the animals
          and plant life are not there to help sustain it properly.

              A more basic cause of environmental degradation is land damage.
              Numerous weedy plant species, for example, garlic & mustard, are
              both foreign and obtrusive. A rupture in the environmental
              surroundings provides for them a chance to start growing and
              spreading. These plants can assume control over nature,
              eliminating the local greenery. The result is a territory with a
              solitary predominant plant which doesn’t give satisfactory food
              assets to all the environmental life. Thus the whole environment
              can be destroyed because of these invasive species.

            <p>
              Overpopulation refers to a population which exceeds its
              sustainable size within a particular environment or habitat.
              Overpopulation results from an increased birth rate, decreased
              death rate, the immigration to a new ecological niche with fewer
              predators, or the sudden decline in available resources.
              Therefore, overpopulation describes a situation in which a
              population in a given ecosystem limit the resources available for
              survival.

              Deforestation is the large-scale removal of trees from forests or
              other lands for the facilitation of human activities 1. It is a
              serious environmental concern since it can result in the loss of
              biodiversity, damage to natural habitats, disturbances in the
              water cycle, and soil erosion 2. Deforestation is also a
              contributor to climate change and global warming

              Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural
              environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form
              of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as
              radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components
              of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or
              naturally occurring contaminants.

              A landfill site, also known as a tip, dump, rubbish dump, garbage
              dump, or dumping ground, is a site for the disposal of waste
              materials. Landfill is the oldest and most common form of waste
              disposal, although the systematic burial of the waste with daily,
              intermediate and final covers only began in the 1940s. In the
              past, refuse was simply left in piles or thrown into pits; in
              archeology this is known as a midden. Some landfill sites are used
              for waste management purposes, such as temporary storage,
              consolidation and transfer, or for various stages of processing
              waste material, such as sorting, treatment, or recycling. Unless
              they are stabilized, landfills may undergo severe shaking or soil
              liquefaction of the ground during an earthquake. Once full, the
              area over a landfill site may be reclaimed for other uses.

              The global demand for fashion and clothing has risen at an
              unprecedented rate that the fashion industry now accounts for 10%
              of global carbon emissions, becoming one of the biggest
              environmental problems of our time. Fashion alone produces more
              greenhouse gas emissions than both the aviation and shipping
              sectors combined, and nearly 20% of global wastewater, or around
              93 billion cubic metres from textile dyeing, according to the UN
              Environment Programme.
