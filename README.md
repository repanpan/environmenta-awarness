## Definition of environmental awareness
Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness
around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its
well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the
earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the
term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why
the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences
of these human decisions and help the planet’s health take a complete
180 degree in the other direction.
